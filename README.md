###Definitions:

Git: A distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system

GitHub: GitHub is a Git repository web-based hosting service which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding many of its own features. GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.

Fork: A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Branch: Branches allow you to build new features or test out ideas without putting your main project at risk.

###Propose changes to someone else's project

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.
